              Welcome to the exciting world of Large Language Models, where machines
              speak our language! This quest is based on the "Hands-On Large Language Models"
              book by Jay Alammar and Maarten Grootendorst.

              Whether it's creating chatbots or building search engines, these models,
              often referred to as LLMs, have transformed AI, enabling machines to
              understand and generate human-like language. LLMs are making waves
              across numerous industries.

              We'll begin by understanding the scope and utility of these models in
              real-world applications.
          - text: Large Language Models (LLMs) are complex AI systems designed to understand, generate, and even translate human language.
          - text: Their primary strength lies in their ability to predict what comes next in a sequence of text, similar to the way a brain might process language.
          - text: LLMs underpin technologies such as chatbots, automated summarizers, and language translation tools.
          - text: The scope of LLMs extends far beyond what's initially apparentâ€”transforming industries by automating tasks and generating human-like text.
          - text: This is just the beginning of our incredible journey together! Are you ready to dive deeper and unlock the secrets of Large Language Models?
